# Student Management Data Structures
</head> <body><p>The Student Management Data Structures project is designed to provide an efficient way of storing and managing student records using four different data structures. The project is built using the C++ programming language and includes an intuitive user interface that allows users to add, remove, search for, and print student records sorted by ID or GPA.

The four data structures used in this project are AVL tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), Min Heap, and Max Heap. Each data structure is optimized for different types of operations, such as inserting, deleting, and searching records, as well as sorting them by ID or GPA. By offering these different data structures, users can compare their performance and choose the one that best fits their needs.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Efficient storage and retrieval of student records using four different data structures.</li>
	<li>User-friendly interface with intuitive menus for each data structure.</li>
	<li>Ability to add, remove, search for, and print student records.</li>
	<li>Sorting of student records by [ID]or GPA depending on the data structure.</li>
	<li>Ability to switch between data structures at runtime to compare performance.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The program is designed to manage a list of student records using four different data structures: AVL tree, Binary Search Tree Min Heap and Max Heap. Each data structure provides the following features:</p>

<h3>AVL Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Add a student record</li>
	<li>Remove a student record</li>
	<li>Search for a student record</li>
	<li>Print all student records sorted by ID</li>
</ul>

<h3>Min Heap and Max Heap</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Add a student record</li>
	<li>Print all student records sorted by GPA</li>
</ul>

<p>To use the program:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Run the program and choose a data structure to use.</li>
	<li>The program will read the student records from the input file and insert them into the chosen data structure.</li>
	<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to add, remove, search for, or print student records.</li>
	<li>To switch to a different data structure, exit the current menu and choose a new data structure from the main menu.</li>
</ol>
